/**
 * A singleton UtteranceQueue that is used for Voicing of joist components. It uses voicingManager
 * to announce utterances using HTML5 SpeechSynthesis. Voicing for joist components can be
 * enabled/disabled separately from other sim Voicing output. The most common case of this
 * is when we want to Voice parts sim settings in the Preferences Dialog even when Voicing
 * is disabled. By enabling Voicing for these components it makes it easier for the user to
 * find settings that would be otherwise not accessible to them unless they enable Voicing.
